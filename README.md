# a_random_quote_generator
 FSJS_1st_project

 A random quote generator is a small single-page application,
 allowing user to display a random famous quotation by clicking on a button.
 Alongside with quote, the source (author), citation, year and tags are displayed if provided (not for all quotes).
 If there is no button click, a new quote automatically displays every 20 seconds.
 With every new quote background color of the page is also being changed automatically.

 Web Technologies used to build the project:
1. Basic Java script: variables, arrays, objects, conditionals and functions;
2. Math.random() function;
2. setInterval() function.
